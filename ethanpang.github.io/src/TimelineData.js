I have participated in the high school division for all four years.\nOn the mechanical side, I helped build robots to compete in competitions by solving various tasks using purchased and machined parts. I also used Computer Aided Design to model and create 3D printed parts.\nFor programming, I used Java and Android Studio to control the robot to perform autonomously through sensor readings, computer vision, and mathematical algorithms. The robot responds to human input via a physical gaming controller and operates autonomously via pre-programmed instructions and sensors.\nOutside of the technical aspect, I organized and lead team outreach efforts to spread industry awareness of FIRST robotics through company tours, teach STEM skills to underrepresnted students through public workshops, and mentor younger robotics teams.\nMy team advanced to the World Championships competition three of the four years and I served as team Co-Captain in the 2019-2020 season.",

        modalDescription: "The COSMOS Summer Program offers high school students the opportunity to learn about and work on a project in a specific STEM field. My group collaboratively built an IOS project under the mentorship of UCI Professor Martin Jaroszewicz. I integrated gyroscopic input with IOS programming to create an app that can simulate sound in a 3D virtual environment. A gyroscope tracks the user's head and headphones play sounds depending on the gyroscope orientation. The sounds is \"placed\" so as to appear to originate from varying directions in the real world, and remain in place no matter how the user turns their head.",

I collaboratively built an Arduino-controlled electronic device equipped with microphones and implemented a sound localization algorithm.\nIts purpose is to detect potentially dangerous events in the surroundings of a hearing-impaired individual. To provide a user interface, an Android mobile app was designed to pair with the Arduino device via Bluetooth.\nLastly, I used a pre-existing machine learning model to classify common urban-setting sounds to demonstrate the device's future uses.",
